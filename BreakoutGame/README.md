# Breadout Game

## What I covered
- turtle module 
- time module 
- creating class and module 
- importing class and module
- while loop
- for loop
- conditionals
- list

## What I have to improve
- Shorten the repeated code.

## Questions for people who are looking at my code
- Is there any way to show all the bricks at the same time in order to make the game take less time to start?
